The Library Management System is a database-based project designed to manage books, members, and book issue-return transactions efficiently. It keeps track of all library resources such as book details, member information, and the records of books that are issued or returned.

This system helps librarians and administrators easily maintain data, reduce manual work, and ensure accurate book tracking. It uses SQL to create and manage tables (Books, Members, and Issue_Return) and to perform operations such as insertion, updating, and retrieval of data. The project ensures data consistency and relationship through primary and foreign keys.


The project consists of three main tables:

Books Table: Stores details such as book title, author, publisher, and available quantity.

Members Table: Holds information about library members, including their name, contact number, and address.

Issue_Return Table: Records the transactions when a book is issued or returned, including dates and status.

This project helps librarians easily add, update, or retrieve records without paperwork. By using SQL commands such as CREATE, INSERT, UPDATE, and SELECT, the system ensures accurate and organized data management.

It demonstrates the use of database normalization, relationships (foreign keys), and query operations—making it a practical example of how relational databases are applied in real-world management systems.

Conclusion:
The Library Management System provides an efficient way to manage library data.
It eliminates manual record keeping, reduces errors, and saves time.
By using SQL and relational database concepts, it ensures data integrity, security, and quick access to information.
It can easily be expanded with a user interface for real-world use.
